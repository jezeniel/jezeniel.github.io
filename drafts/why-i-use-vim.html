      <p><a href="https://www.vim.org">Vim</a> (<em>Vi IMproved</em>) is an open source text editor created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar">Bram Moolenar</a>
in 1991, which is an enhanced clone of vi, an older text editor. It is
usable inside your favorite terminal or can be a standalone application.</p>
<p>It is keyboard driven, this means that you don&rsquo;t need to use a mouse to navigate.
Your hands doesn&rsquo;t even need to travel far away from the home row keys due to the
bindings like <code>hjkl</code> way of navigating (though you can still use arrow keys). Vim is also very 
configurable and has tons of <a href="https://vimawesome.com/">plugins</a> you can use to improve experience.</p>
<p>There are also lots of fun things happening around the Vim universe.
Quitting Vim became a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=vim+meme&amp;tbm=isch">meme</a>, it is also one of the top <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/">StackOverflow</a>
questions, and there is even a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLbfqZBL8t8">speedrun</a> video! You can also play <a href="https://www.vimgolf.com/">vimgolf</a>
to test your vim skills, or even play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_27mpiU-Zmg">tetris</a>.</p>

<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<p>My adventures in vim started when I began using Linux, tutorials and guides
around the internet sometimes uses it to modify configurations and files.</p>
<p>The first time I used it while following a guide &ndash; I can&rsquo;t even insert any text,
then I started typing random characters until I pressed some unknown keys that
allowed me to insert something. After editing, I still need to Google 
how to save my work and quit vim.</p>

<p>Then I saw the <a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/">&ldquo;Learn Vim Progressively&rdquo;</a>
blog post. The article mentioned vim to be a &ldquo;Six Billion Dollar editor&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the best text editor known to human kind&rdquo;. After reading the post,
the promise of improved productivity is too hard to pass, and the young me
also wanted to be a cool and l33t programmer. I am using vim ever since.</p>
<h2>Why use it?</h2>
<p>Vim introduced me to the world of <em>modal</em> text editors. This means
you can switch to different modes, between invoking commands and entering texts,
the function of keys will also change depending on the mode.</p>
<p>This is quite different from the usual <em>modeless</em> text editors today like  Notepad,
Notepad++ and GEdit, in which you can enter text right away after opening. 
Though some of these editors are <em>modeless</em> by default, some editors like Emacs, Sublime
and VSCode have plugin systems which can emulate vim.</p>
<p>To compare shortcuts between <em>modal</em> and <em>modeless</em> editors, here are some 
comparison between vim and vscode:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>action</th>
<th>vim</th>
<th>vscode</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>cut line</td>
<td><code>dd</code></td>
<td><code>Ctrl + x</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>copy line</td>
<td><code>yy</code></td>
<td><code>Ctrl + c</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>move line up/down</td>
<td>n/a</td>
<td><code>Alt + ↑/↓</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>jump to matching bracket</td>
<td><code>%</code></td>
<td><code>Ctrl + Shift + \</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>insert line below</td>
<td><code>o</code></td>
<td><code>Ctrl + Enter</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>insert line above</td>
<td><code>O</code></td>
<td><code>Ctrl + Shift + Enter</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>go to beginning/end of line</td>
<td><code>0</code>/<code>$</code></td>
<td><code>Home</code>/<code>End</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>go to the beginning of file</td>
<td><code>gg</code></td>
<td><code>Ctrl + Home</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>go to the end of file</td>
<td><code>G</code></td>
<td><code>Ctrl + End</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Comparing between the two, because of the <em>modeless</em> nature of vscode, it is
reliant on using modifier keys like <code>Ctrl</code> and <code>Alt</code> to execute commands.
But it doesn&rsquo;t mean that vim is better than vscode. Vscode also have nice features
out of the box that you still need to configure/add to vim.</p>
<p>What I am trying to show here is that due to the <em>modal</em> nature of vim, it
doesn&rsquo;t rely so much on modifier keys, which lessens <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chording">chording</a> and
keyboard travel time. This results in increased productivity once you get
used to it.</p>
<p>In vim the usual modes being used are <code>NORMAL</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>VISUAL</code>, <code>COMMAND</code> and <code>REPLACE</code>.</p>
<h3>Normal Mode</h3>
<p><code>NORMAL</code> mode is the default whenever you start vim.  You cannot type any text,
but instead, this is where you can do navigation, text manipulation, undo/redo
and many more. You can also configure custom commands to run in this mode.
You will need to switch back to this mode by pressing <code>ESC</code> before
changing to other modes.</p>
<h3>Insert Mode</h3>
<p><code>INSERT</code> mode is the most familiar mode, due to being the default or only
mode of <em>modeless</em> editors. This is where you, as the name suggests,
insert/type texts. Press <code>i</code> so you can go from <code>NORMAL</code> to <code>INSERT</code> mode.</p>
<h3>Visual Mode</h3>
<p><code>VISUAL</code> mode is for highlighting/selecting lines or blocks of texts. It is similar
to using <code>SHIFT</code> and arrow keys in <em>modeless</em> text editors, this allows you to
apply commands only to the selected texts. You can use <code>v</code> to select by
characters or <code>V</code> to highlight lines of texts.</p>
<h3>Command Mode</h3>
<p><code>COMMAND</code> mode is like a command line input. You can go to this mode by pressing
<code>:</code>. This is where you can save <code>:w</code>, quit <code>:q</code>, save, quit <code>:wq</code> or call
vim functions.</p>
<h3>Replace Mode</h3>
<p><code>REPLACE</code> mode is like using the <code>Insert</code> key of your keyboard. It will
replace text from the starting point. You can activate this by pressing <code>R</code>.</p>
<p>As of writing, vim is the only modal editor I used.</p>
<h2>Takeaway</h2>
<p>Vim is not a perfect text editor, but it introduced me to a more efficient
way of doing my work and not about being cool or l33t. It taught me that people
can find ways to innovate/improve something that were considered good enough.</p>
<p>I also use vscode, pycharm and Android Studio, sometimes vim is not the best fit 
for some projects, and it might be better to just use other editors or IDEs.
But I am glad that the community creates vim emulation plugins to these programs
so I can have the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>In the end it is what is the best one, its what makes you more happy in doing
what you love.</p>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<p>For modeless text editor lovers, you can try vim mode! Here are some
good vim emulation plugins for your favorite text editors:</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim">IdeaVim</a> for IntelliJ platform like Jetbrains products or Android Studio</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NeoVintageous/NeoVintageous">NeoVintageous</a> for SublimeText</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim">VSCodeVimA</a> for vscode</li>
