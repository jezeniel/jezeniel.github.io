Hi I am Jezeniel, a software engineer. I primarily use Python and Javascript
in my work and side projects. I love talking and learning about web development, 
system design, software engineering, open source software and video games.

I also contribute to some open source projects (not as much as I want to)
that I use.

I live in Manila, Philippines together with my wife and daughter.

Do you have any comments, feedback, suggestions or ... violent reactions? 
I would love to hear from you.
