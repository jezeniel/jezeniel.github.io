[Vim][vim] (*VI IMproved*) is a text editor created by [Bram Moolenar][Bram]
in 1991, an enhanced clone of an older text editor vi. It has a [speedrun][speedrun], 
and made a million of people go to [StackOverflow][helping million] just to learn 
how to quit it. It is also my favorite text editor.

## The Beginning

My adventures in Vim started when I started learning Linux. Tutorials/troubleshooting 
guides in the forums sometimes uses vi/vim when modifying files. As expected, I had
a hard time quitting the damn editor, I don't know how to type, even save!

I was intrigued by the idea of doing everything in the terminal. So I tried trying
to learn and used it on and off for a long time. Then I stumbled upon the 
["Learn Vim Progressively"][learn vim prog] blog post. The article mentioned 
Vim to be a "Six Billion Dollar editor" and "the best text editor known to human kind". 
After reading the article, and seeing what Vim is capable of I was determined to 
learn and use it once and for all.

Vim introduced me to the world of modal text editing, which is quite different 
from the usual modeless text editors like Notepad, GEdit, Notepad++.
