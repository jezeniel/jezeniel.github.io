We stayed in Metro Manila since 2017, and rented a condo unit in Pasig City
in order for our daughter to come live with us. Living in Metro Manila was both 
great and stressful, great in a way that a lot of things are accessible and
available. Traveling around is fairly easy due to ride booking services like
Grab. That&amp;rsquo;s why me and my wife mostly used Grab when going out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Grab is convenient, it is quite expensive, this is why I still
need to commute when going to work. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-49983397" target="_blank"&gt;Commuting&lt;/a&gt; in Metro Manila is
tough most of the time, I spend 30 minutes to 1 hour in queue just to get a
ride. I averaged 2 hours per day just for commuting, and in bad days it can take
up to 3 hours. When it rains, it is another story for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another option, driving your own car. But doing this, in my opinion,
is not advisable due to expensive parking space, rude drivers and severe
&lt;a href="https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/10/28/1964084/metro-manila-worst-drive-in-according-waze-ranking" target="_blank"&gt;traffic&lt;/a&gt;. In some places they implement their own traffic schemes which
prevents you to travel through those areas, leaving you no choice but to commute
anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to avoid severe traffic I stay in the office until later hours, time that
I could&amp;rsquo;ve spent with my family. I always thought whenever I get stuck in
traffic in a cramped vehicle, that this is not a good way to spend time and
I need to find a way to get out of this cycle. I have been reading articles online
about fully remote companies that don&amp;rsquo;t require you to go to office, all of the work
is being done through the internet. This means more &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; for my family;
this means no daily &lt;em&gt;commute&lt;/em&gt;. This, my friends, is my solution to break the cycle.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I started looking for a remote job and luckily, I found one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Working Remotely&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got hired last June as a Staff Engineer, my responsibilities are mentoring,
R&amp;amp;D, improvement of engineering process and leading some of our projects.
We do two week sprints and daily standups every morning through &lt;a href="https://meet.google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google
Meet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sococo.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Sococo&lt;/a&gt;. Our team also has a bi-weekly meet up
in which I travel back to Metro Manila to do tech talks, catch up and hangout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few months, we were able to move back in our province. My stress levels
went down significantly, I have more time with my wife and kid, and I can visit
my parents more frequently. Cost of living is also cheaper, we can buy more
healthy food and can save some of our earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working remotely is great, but it has it&amp;rsquo;s fair share of challenges. Communication
has a much more important role, you can&amp;rsquo;t just tap your colleague&amp;rsquo;s shoulder,
do impromptu meetings or discussions. But due to faster and cheaper internet, the
rise of softwares like Slack, Jira, and Skype, collaborating online is easier.
Company culture and trust with your colleagues matters now more than ever. It is really
different from the typical staying and working in a co-located place, new processes
and practices should be implemented for it to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While remote work is also gaining more &lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=60&amp;amp;date=2010-01-01%202019-12-01&amp;amp;q=remote" target="_blank"&gt;popularity&lt;/a&gt; throughout the years,
I hope it is here to stay and in my opinion more companies will adapt it. In the
future I will write more about my experiences and things I tried which worked or did not.
For now, I am very grateful to have such a great opportunity and more time to spend
on what matter most.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="personal"></category><category term="remote work"></category></entry><entry><title>Why I Use Vim</title><link href="https://jezeniel.github.io/blog/2019/09/why-i-use-vim/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-03T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-09-03T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Jezeniel  Zapanta</name></author><id>tag:jezeniel.github.io,2019-09-03:/blog/2019/09/why-i-use-vim/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vim.org" target="_blank"&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; is an open source text editor created by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar" target="_blank"&gt;Bram Moolenar&lt;/a&gt;

custom shortcuts, commands, and has tons of &lt;a href="https://vimawesome.com/" target="_blank"&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt; to improve your
workflow. You can run it in your favorite terminal or as a stand-alone
application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim has gained a reputation of being hard to quit, causing it to have
a &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=vim+meme&amp;amp;tbm=isch" target="_blank"&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLbfqZBL8t8" target="_blank"&gt;speedrun&lt;/a&gt; video, and be one of the
top &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/" target="_blank"&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; questions. You can also do fun things like
&lt;a href="https://www.vimgolf.com/" target="_blank"&gt;vim golfing&lt;/a&gt; to test your skills, or even play &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_27mpiU-Zmg" target="_blank"&gt;Tetris&lt;/a&gt; inside
vim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://jezeniel.github.io/images/why_vim/vim.png"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now I am stuck forever&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My adventures in vim began when I started using Linux. Tutorials and guides
around the internet sometimes use it to modify configurations and files.
My first time in using vim is when I tried modifying a config for a software
that I was using. I fired it up and &amp;hellip; I can&amp;rsquo;t even insert any text, then I
started maniacally typing random characters until I pressed some unknown key 
that allowed me to insert something. After editing, I still need to Google how
to save my work and quit vim!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://jezeniel.github.io/images/why_vim/not_sudo.png"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;I forgot to use sudo again for the nth time...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I read the &lt;a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Learn Vim Progressively&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; blog post. It
mentioned vim as a &amp;ldquo;Six Billion Dollar editor&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the best text editor
known to humankind&amp;rdquo;. The promise of improved productivity is too hard to pass.
The young me thought that if I can do everything in the terminal without
relying on a GUI, it will make me a cool and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet" target="_blank"&gt;l33t&lt;/a&gt; programmer.
Maybe I tried learning it for the wrong reasons, either way I pushed myself 
to use it even though my productivity suffered a bit because of the learning
curve. Eventually, I got used to it and I am using vim ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="image"&gt;
  &lt;img src="https://jezeniel.github.io/images/why_vim/hackerman.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;I can be like this, minus the mullet.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why use it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim is a &lt;em&gt;modal&lt;/em&gt; text editor, this means it has different modes that you can use.
Keybindings, commands, and actions will change depending on the mode.
This is quite different from the usual &lt;em&gt;modeless&lt;/em&gt; text editors today like Notepad,
Notepad++ and GEdit, in which you can enter text right away at the start. 
Though some of these editors are &lt;em&gt;modeless&lt;/em&gt; by default, editors like Emacs, Sublime
and VSCode have plugin systems that can emulate vim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare shortcuts between &lt;em&gt;modal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;modeless&lt;/em&gt; editors, here is some
comparison between vim (in &lt;code&gt;NORMAL&lt;/code&gt; mode) and vscode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;action&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;vim&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;vscode&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;cut line&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;copy line&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;yy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;move line up/down&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;n/a&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Alt + ↑/↓&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;jump to matching bracket&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + Shift + \&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;insert line below&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + Enter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;insert line above&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + Shift + Enter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;go to beginning/end of line&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Home&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;End&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;go to the beginning of file&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;gg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + Home&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;go to the end of file&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;G&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + End&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the &lt;em&gt;modeless&lt;/em&gt; nature of vscode, it relies on using modifier keys 
like &lt;code&gt;Ctrl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Alt&lt;/code&gt; to execute commands.  But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that vim is
better than vscode. Vscode has nice features out of the box that you still need
to configure/add to vim. What I am trying to show here is that due to the
&lt;em&gt;modal&lt;/em&gt; nature of vim, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t rely much on modifier keys. This lessens
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chording" target="_blank"&gt;chording&lt;/a&gt; and keyboard travel time, which increases productivity
once you get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vim, the usual modes being used are &lt;code&gt;NORMAL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;VISUAL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;COMMAND&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;REPLACE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Normal Mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NORMAL&lt;/code&gt; mode is the default whenever you start vim.  You cannot type any text,
but instead, this is where you can do navigation, text manipulation, undo/redo
and many more. You will need to switch back to this mode by pressing &lt;code&gt;ESC&lt;/code&gt; before
changing to other modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Insert Mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; mode is the most familiar mode, due to being the only mode of &lt;em&gt;modeless&lt;/em&gt; editors. 
This is where you, as the name suggests, insert/type texts.  Pressing &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; will
make you switch from &lt;code&gt;NORMAL&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt; mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Visual Mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;VISUAL&lt;/code&gt; mode is for highlighting/selecting lines or blocks of texts, it is similar
to using &lt;code&gt;SHIFT&lt;/code&gt; and arrow keys in &lt;em&gt;modeless&lt;/em&gt; text editors. You can press &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; to select by
characters or &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; to highlight lines of texts, this allows you to apply commands
only to the selected texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Command Mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;COMMAND&lt;/code&gt; mode is like a command line input. You can go to this mode by pressing
&lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;. This is where you can save &lt;code&gt;:w&lt;/code&gt;, quit &lt;code&gt;:q&lt;/code&gt;, save and quit &lt;code&gt;:wq&lt;/code&gt; or call
vim functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Replace Mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;REPLACE&lt;/code&gt; mode is like using the &lt;code&gt;Insert&lt;/code&gt; key of your keyboard. It will
replace text from the starting point until you go back to &lt;code&gt;NORMAL&lt;/code&gt; mode. 
You can activate this by pressing &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still lots of things you can do in vim, and this is just the tip 
of the iceberg. &lt;a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Learn Vim Progressively&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://vimcasts.org" target="_blank"&gt;Vimcasts&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;vimtutor&lt;/code&gt; which is already installed when you install vim in Linux are good place to
start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vim is not a perfect text editor, but it introduced me to a more efficient
way of doing my work. It taught me that people can still find ways to
innovate/improve something that was considered good enough. There are times 
that vim is not the best fit for some projects, and it might be better to just
use other editors or IDEs like PyCharm and Android Studio. However, I am glad that
the community of awesome programmers creates vim emulation plugins so we
can enjoy the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it is not about what is the best one (because there isn&amp;rsquo;t any), and 
neither about being cool nor l33t. It is about what makes you do your work
enjoyable and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For modeless text editor lovers, you can try vim mode! Here are some
good vim emulation plugins for your favorite text editors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil" target="_blank"&gt;Evil&lt;/a&gt; for Emacs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim" target="_blank"&gt;IdeaVim&lt;/a&gt; for IntelliJ platform like Jetbrains products or Android Studio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/NeoVintageous/NeoVintageous" target="_blank"&gt;NeoVintageous&lt;/a&gt; for SublimeText&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim" target="_blank"&gt;VSCodeVimA&lt;/a&gt; for vscode&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13809943" target="_blank"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; in HN to ask about this. It did not received that much
attention but some people still gave me great tips and advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some excerpts from the comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of fear is very normal, and is what stops a lot of
people from giving a lot of value back to the world by writing
about their area of expertise. If you overcome it, you&amp;rsquo;ll help not 
only yourself but also lots of other people. &amp;ndash; thenomad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody makes mistakes, including bloggers. From my experience, 
if something is wrong or doesn&amp;rsquo;t work your readers will let you know in the comments. 
Just be humble and ready to correct your mistakes and there should be no issues.
&amp;ndash; jetti&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, everyone who writes on the internet has been wrong.
Everyone. You aren&amp;rsquo;t going to be this horrible exception, the one
person who said one thing wrong on an otherwise-perfect internet.
So go ahead. Write. Make mistakes.
&amp;ndash; AnimalMuppet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These comments ring true to me, even smart people make mistakes.
The intention to share and impart knowledge is the one that should matter.
Even making a mistake and being corrected by others is an opportunity
to learn and meet someone new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So what now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing it is the middle of 2018, more than a year has passed since 
I asked the question in HN. The time of being afraid is done. This is the time 
that I will push myself out of the comfort zone and start writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am inspired by blogs of awesome people like &lt;a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Armin Ronacher&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://www.kennethreitz.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Kenneth Reitz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Jeff Atwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt;
and many more. Their works and writings greatly helped me be a better engineer
and maybe someday I can do the same to other people like them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator in creating this blog to avoid
managing a cloud server and database. 
My blog&amp;rsquo;s theme is a modifed version of &lt;a href="https://github.com/nandomoreirame/end2end" target="_blank"&gt;end2end&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I can continue this endeavor to contribute to this open and free 
well of knowledge, no matter how small it can be. Maybe one day someone will
stumble upon one of my posts and help them solve their problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that this will also help other people to start writing and blogging about
the things they want to share and are afraid to do so. Until next time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="personal"></category></entry></feed>
